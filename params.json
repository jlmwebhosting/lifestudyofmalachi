{"name":"Lifestudyofmalachi","tagline":"","body":"Welcome to Life Study of Malachi\r\n\r\nIn God's creation there are principles. For instance, if we want to see different colors, we must use our eyes. Suppose I were blind. Could I hear the colors? Could I smell them? Certainly not! In order to see colors, we must use the proper organ. The principle is the same in relation to us and God. God is real, yet some dare to say that there is no God. Of course, if we do not exercise our spirit, surely there is no God to us. We cannot touch God by means of our physical body. Neither can we realize Him by our mentality, by our mind, for this is not the proper organ to use in contacting God. God is Spirit. If we would worship Him, contacting Him and receiving Him, we must exercise our spirit. Thank God that in His creation He made three crucial, equally important matters—the heavens, the earth, and our spirit. Our spirit, therefore, is as crucial, as important, as the heavens and the earth.\r\n\r\nGod's purpose is for us to receive Christ. However, Christ is complex in all that He is. He is all-inclusive, because He is so many items. Furthermore, this all-inclusive Christ is very involved with history, politics, and governments. How can we understand such a One? The only way is, after reading and studying, to turn ourselves to prayer. When we turn ourselves to prayer, we exercise our spirit. At that moment, Christ imparts Himself into us. This is the heavenly, divine dispensing. Through this dispensing we receive Christ as our life, our light, our patience, our love, our everything.\r\n\r\nIn this divine war, Christ will destroy Antichrist \"by the breath of His mouth\" and bring him to nothing \"by the manifestation of His coming\" (2 Thes. 2:8). These are the weapons Christ will use to defeat Antichrist.\r\n\r\nThis war will be the great winepress of the fury of God trodden by Christ at His coming back to judge the world (Rev. 14:17-20; Isa. 63:1-6). So many evil ones who hate God will join Antichrist in fighting against God. When these evil ones are gathered to Armageddon, they will actually be the grapes to be trodden by God in the winepress of the fury of His wrath. In bringing his armies and so many evil ones together, Antichrist will actually be doing a work for God.\r\n\r\n7. The Nations That Participate\r\nBeing Gathered Also by Jehovah God\r\nThe nations that will participate in that international war against Jerusalem will be gathered also by God. Half of the city of Jerusalem will be brought into captivity, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city (Zech. 14:2). In His mercy God will still preserve half of His elect people.\r\n8. Jehovah Making Jerusalem\r\na Cup of Reeling and a Burdensome Stone\r\nto All the Besieging Peoples\r\nJehovah will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling and a burdensome stone to all the besieging peoples, that is, to the armies of Antichrist and to all the evil ones with him. God will cause their horses to be bewildered and blind and their riders to be mad (12:2-4). Jerusalem will need divine protection not only against Antichrist and his armies but also against Satan and his demons and evil spirits. We may not know how God will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling and a burdensome stone, but we know that He will do this.\r\n\r\nJehovah of hosts will be the strength of the inhabitants of Jerusalem and will make the leaders of Judah like a fire pot under wood and like a torch of fire among sheaves, and they will consume all the surrounding peoples on the right and on the left. Jerusalem will dwell again in her own place. Jehovah will save the tents of Judah first and then the house of David and Jerusalem. In that day Jehovah will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, making the feeble among them like David and the house of David like God, like the Angel of Jehovah (Christ) before them. (In 12:8 the Angel of Jehovah is in apposition to God.) Moreover, Jehovah will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem (12:5-9).\r\n11. Jehovah as Christ Coming with His Saints\r\nZechariah 14:3-7 reveals that Jehovah as Christ will then come with His saints and go forth to fight against Satan, embodied in Antichrist, and his followers, the nations.\r\na. The Feet of Jehovah as Christ\r\nStanding on the Mount of Olives\r\nThe feet of Jehovah as Christ will stand in that day on the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east. The Mount of Olives will be split at its middle toward the east and toward the west into a very great valley so that half of the mountain will remove to the north and half of it to the south (v. 4).\r\nb. The Remnant of Israel Fleeing\r\ninto the Valley of Jehovah's Mountains\r\nThe remnant of Israel will flee into the valley of Jehovah's mountains (v. 5).\r\nc. In That Day There Being No Light\r\nIn that day there will be no light; the shining ones (the sun, the moon, and the stars) will withdraw. It will be a kind of day known only to Jehovah, neither day nor night. But at evening time there will be light (vv. 6-7). This indicates that God will change many things in the universe in order to judge the evil human beings and to save His elect.\r\n\r\nBy the time of the Lord's second appearing, the remnant of Israel will have suffered all kinds of hardship. They suffered the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70 and were scattered to other countries. In these other countries they continued to suffer persecution. Today most of the Jews remain in dispersion, but many are returning to the nation of Israel. At the time of Antichrist, two-thirds in all the land of Israel will be slaughtered (13:8-9a). Half of the city of Jerusalem will go forth into captivity (14:2). The half which remains will no longer have any taste for human life or for acquiring possessions and high positions. They will realize that they are short of God and will exercise their spirit (12:1), not their mind. At this juncture they will repent, because they have lost their taste for everything. The Holy Spirit will be poured out upon them, and they will follow their spirit to be fully occupied with God. I believe that because they will have learned that everything apart from God is vanity and because they will exercise their spirit, the pouring out of the Spirit of God upon them will be intensified. The Jews on the day of Pentecost were stubborn and hard. Hence, the Spirit of power was poured out to inspire them to repent. But the inhabitants of Jerusalem in Zechariah 12:10 will have already repented; therefore, the Spirit of grace will be poured out upon them so that they can receive the Triune God as their enjoyment.\r\nZechariah 12:10a also tells us that they will look upon Him whom they have pierced. This means that they will look upon the Christ who was pierced by them. Revelation 1:7a refers to this: \"Behold, He comes with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him.\" The piercing of Christ is the foundation of redemption. Apart from Christ's being pierced, there would be no base for our redemption.\r\nThe repentant Jews will look upon the One whom they have pierced. Although it was their forefathers who pierced the Lord Jesus, God counts that as something done by these repentant ones. The reason for this is that in the sight of God the entire people of Israel is one person.\r\n\r\nVerse 6 goes on to say, \"Someone will say to Him, What are these wounds between Your arms? And He will say, Those with which I was wounded in the house of those who love Me.\" In this verse the phrase \"those who love Me\" refers to Christ's relatives, the children of Israel. The children of Israel killed Him, but He counted their action as wounds from those who loved Him. This is very sweet.\r\n\r\n 2) In the Great Tribulation\r\nTwo-thirds of Them Being Cut Off by Antichrist\r\nIn the great tribulation at the consummation of the present age, in all the land of Israel two-thirds of them will be cut off by Antichrist in his persecution of the Jews (Zech. 13:8a; Rev. 11:2; 13:7).\r\n3) One-third of the Remnant Being Left in the Land\r\nOne-third of the remnant will be left in the land and will be brought through fire and refined like silver and tried like gold by the persecution of Antichrist (Zech. 13:8b-9a). These will be those who are written in the book as the secret record (Dan. 12:1b).\r\n4) They Calling on the Lord's Name\r\nand the Lord Answering Them\r\nThey will call on the Lord's name, and the Lord will answer them. The Lord will say that they are His people, and they will say that the Lord is their God (Zech. 13:9b). They will be saved into the enjoyment of the riches of the Triune God, first in the millennium to be the priests to teach the nations and then in the New Jerusalem to participate in all the blessings God has ordained in eternity and for eternity. This is the household salvation to Israel.\r\n\r\nEveryone left from all the nations that went forth against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles (v. 16). Whoever does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, upon them there will be no rain, but there will be the plague with which Jehovah strikes the nations. This will be their sin (vv. 17-19). Because the present age is the age of grace, God sends rain on the just and the unjust alike (Matt. 5:45). But the coming age will be the age of righteousness. Those who do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles will not receive rain. This is righteous.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am concerned that the dear saints who have been brought into the Lord's recovery have mainly received help first in the assurance of salvation and then in such matters as godliness, ethics, spirituality, and overcoming. All these things are very good. Nevertheless, I do not believe that many among us in the Lord's recovery are clear about God's economy. God's economy is to dispense Christ into His elect that they might become first the Body of Christ to express Him and then the bride of Christ to match Him and fulfill God's economy in the divine dispensing. Of course, I am happy that so many have come to receive help to seek God, to seek Christ, to grow in life, and to be more godly, more spiritual, and more overcoming, but I am not satisfied with this. I would rather that we all had the eyes to see God's economy. My intention, my goal, in all these messages is to help you to advance beyond the realm of seeking for spirituality into another realm to see God's desire, God's good pleasure.\r\nAccording to His eternal arrangement, or economy, God desires to have the church, a proper church in the biblical sense. Christianity is a totality of organization, but the church revealed in the Bible should be absolutely organic and full of Christ as life, full of the Triune God in His consummation—the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit—to constitute us with God's life and nature and to join us with God as one spirit. This is God's economy through His dispensing.\r\nToday in Christianity, even among the most spiritual ones, what is taught is not food but sugar. That kind of teaching harms you more than it nourishes you. If you read these messages for the purpose merely to receive help to be more seeking after God, more seeking after Christ, and to grow in life, even this is in the realm of sugar. You need solid food (Heb. 5:11-14). Whereas milk is for babes, solid food is for the mature. Among the millions of Christians today, who is not a babe? We have been carrying out the life-study of the Scriptures now for seventeen years, yet most of the saints are still remaining, lingering, wandering, in the realm of being spiritual, victorious, overcoming, and so forth. Very few, even among the co-workers, are qualified to give a message on God's economy with the divine dispensing. We need to be brought into another realm, not the so-called spiritual realm but the realm of God's economy, God's dispensing. I will not be satisfied until I see this. I am somewhat happy that the Lord has released all these truths among us, and I have the full faith and assurance that all these things will eventually be realized; yet I long to see their fulfillment.\r\n\r\n WORSHIPPING GOD IN SPIRIT\r\nAt this point I would like to remind you of the Lord's conversation with the Samaritan woman in John 4. The Lord Jesus said to her, \"Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life\" (v. 14). When she asked Him to give her this water, He told her to go and call her husband (vv. 15-16). His intention was to help her to know her sins. However, she immediately turned the conversation to the matter of worship, saying, \"Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, yet you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship\" (v. 20). The Lord Jesus replied, \"An hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father....But an hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truthfulness...God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness\" (vv. 21, 23-24). John 4:24, a wonderful verse, matches Zechariah 12:1 and Isaiah 42:5.\r\nIn His word to the Samaritan woman, the Lord Jesus seemed to be saying, \"Woman, you do not know what it is to worship God. The real worship of God is not on a mountain or in Jerusalem—it is in your spirit. Only by using your spirit can you touch God. I am your God, and I am here as living water for you to drink of Me. The way to drink this living water is to exercise your spirit. This is what it means to worship the Father.\" God has given us a spirit that we may worship Him by drinking of Him.\r\nTHE LORD BEING WITH OUR SPIRIT\r\nAnother crucial verse concerning the human spirit is 2 Timothy 4:22. \"The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.\" This verse does not say that the Lord is with our mind or soul or heart; it tells us that He is with our spirit. Deep within, in the center of our being, we have a particular organ—the human spirit—created by God for the purpose of receiving Him and containing Him. We all, especially the young people, need to see that today the Lord Jesus Christ is with our spirit.\r\nOUR SPIRIT AND THE SEVENFOLD INTENSIFIED SPIRIT\r\nOur regenerated human spirit matches Christ, who is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). Regarding this, Zechariah 3:9 says, \"This is the stone that I have set before Joshua: upon one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave its engraving, declares Jehovah of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.\" This stone which has been engraved with God's engraving to take away the sin of God's people is Christ. The seven eyes of the stone are \"the eyes of Jehovah running to and fro on the whole earth\" (4:10). In order to understand the significance of the seven eyes, we need to consider Revelation 5:6. \"I saw..a Lamb standing as having just been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.\" The Lamb here, who is the stone in Zechariah 3:9, is Christ, and the seven eyes are the sevenfold intensified Spirit. Thus, the Christ who has been engraved by God to take away our sin bears the sevenfold intensified Spirit. Actually, He, the last Adam, has become a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), even the sevenfold intensified Spirit. Christ today is the Spirit, and we have a spirit particularly formed by God to match Christ.\r\nLet us now go on to consider the Christ who is unveiled in the book of Zechariah. In the first part of this book (chs. 1—6), there are five visions concerning Christ, and in the last part (chs. 9—14), many details concerning Christ.\r\n\r\nno rain (v. 17).\r\nCHRIST AND THE TEMPLE OF GOD\r\nThe book of Zechariah clearly reveals that God desires the rebuilding of the temple (4:9; 6:12-15). However, without Christ everything, including the temple, is empty. We need Christ, yet Christ needs a Body. This Body is the temple of God, the house of God, the expression of God, the satisfaction of God. Hence, today we should emphasize both Christ and the church. Concerning Christ, we need to pay attention both to the crucial aspects unveiled in chapters one through six and to the details unveiled in chapters nine through fourteen.\r\n\r\nA. Jehovah Loving Jacob but Hating Esau\r\nIn verses 2b and 3a Jehovah utters a very frank word related to Jacob and Esau. He says, \"I loved Jacob; but Esau I hated.\"\r\n\r\n III. JEHOVAH'S DEALING WITH THE SONS OF LEVI\r\n(THE PRIESTS)\r\nIn 1:6—3:4 we have Jehovah's dealing with the sons of Levi, that is, His dealing with the priests.\r\nA. The Degradation of the Priests\r\nMalachi 1:6-14 is a word regarding the degradation of the priests.\r\n1. Despising Jehovah's Name and His Table\r\nThe degradation of the priests was seen first in their despising Jehovah's name and His table (vv. 6-7, 12-13a). They cared neither for Jehovah's name nor for the enjoyment of His table.\r\n2. Presenting to Jehovah\r\nBlemished Offerings\r\nThe priests presented to Jehovah blemished offerings, offerings that were blind, lame, or sick (v. 8). They brought what was stolen, lame, and sick and offered it as a sacrifice (v. 13b). Thus, Jehovah said, \"Cursed be the deceiver who has in his flock a male, and when he makes a vow, he offers what is blemished to the Lord\" (v. 14a).\r\n3. Jehovah's Abhorring of Their Offerings\r\nJehovah did not have any joy in receiving their blemished offerings. On the contrary, He abhorred them (vv. 9-10).\r\n4. The Greatness of Jehovah's Name\r\namong the Nations\r\nIn verses 11 and 14b we have a word concerning the greatness of Jehovah's name among the nations. In verse 11 He said that His name would be great among the nations, and in verse 14b He declared that His name was feared among the nations.\r\n\r\nD. Jehovah's Hatred of the Treachery\r\nof Man toward His Wife\r\nIn verses 13 through 17 we see Jehovah's hatred of the treachery of man (mainly referring to the priests) toward his wife.\r\n1. The Treachery of a Priest\r\ntoward His Wife Damaging His Priesthood\r\nVerses 13 and 14 indicate that the treachery of a priest toward his wife damages his priesthood. Probably some of the mistreated wives came and wept at the altar (vv. 13a, 14). Because of this, Jehovah no longer regarded the sacrifices or received them with pleasure from the priests' hands (v. 13b). Here we see a very important matter. If a servant of the Lord cannot have a proper life with his wife, his service will be annulled.\r\nEvery young person must consider his or her marriage very carefully. All the brothers and sisters are priests. If we cannot live well with our spouse, how can we serve the church? If our married life is improper, our priesthood will be finished; it will be brought to nothing.\r\n2. Jehovah Making the Priest and His Wife One\r\nin Order to Produce the Seed of God\r\nIn verse 15 Malachi goes on to say that in marriage God has made the husband and wife one in order to produce \"the seed of God,\" that is, godly children.\r\n\r\n 3. Jehovah Hating Divorce\r\nJehovah hates divorce; and the one who divorces his wife behaves in violence (v. 16). In the sight of God, divorce is a violent act.\r\n4. Jehovah Being Wearied\r\nwith the Priests' Words\r\nAccording to verse 17, the priests wearied Jehovah with their words. They wearied Him by saying, \"Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of Jehovah, and He delights in them; or, Where is the God of justice?\" Such words were wrongful accusations.\r\nE. To Refine and Purify the Priests\r\nby His Coming as the Messenger of Jehovah\r\nJehovah's dealing with the sons of Levi is to refine and purify the priests by His coming as the Messenger of Jehovah (3:1-4).\r\n1. This Prophecy Having a Threefold Fulfillment\r\nThis prophecy has a threefold fulfillment.\r\na. In the Coming of the Prophet Malachi\r\nFirst, this prophecy was fulfilled in the coming of the prophet Malachi, the type of Christ as the coming One.\r\nb. In the First Coming of Christ\r\nwith John the Baptist as His Forerunner\r\nSecond, this prophecy was fulfilled in the first coming of Christ with John the Baptist as His forerunner (Matt. 11:7-13). In His first coming, Christ came as a Messenger and even as the message sent by God to adjust, refine, and purify the priests. In the Gospels the Lord Jesus frequently rebuked the priests.\r\n\r\n c. In the Second Coming of Christ\r\nwith Elijah as His Forerunner\r\nThird, this prophecy will be fulfilled in the second coming of Christ with Elijah as His forerunner (Isa. 40:3-5, 9-11; Matt. 17:11; Rev. 11:3-4).\r\n2. Christ Suddenly Coming\r\nas the Angel of the Covenant\r\nChrist will come suddenly as the Angel of the covenant, whom the people of Israel seek and whom the people of Israel desire (Mal. 3:1; Hag. 2:7a).\r\na. To Execute upon Israel the Covenant\r\nThat He Enacted through His Death\r\nChrist's coming suddenly as the Angel of the covenant will be to execute upon Israel the covenant that He enacted through His death (Matt. 26:28). He came in the sense of an Angel to serve God in forming the new testament. When He established His table on the night in which He was betrayed, the Lord Jesus told us that He was enacting the new covenant: \"This cup is the new covenant established in My blood\" (Luke 22:20). Thus He formed the new testament, in which God is obligated to dispense Himself into our being to be our life, our life law, and our everything as our content. Although the Lord Jesus enacted the new covenant nearly two thousand years ago, generally speaking the Jewish people have not benefitted by it. Instead, the benefit has gone to the Gentiles. However, when Christ comes back, He will come as the Angel of the covenant to execute His covenant over the repentant and believing Jews. At that time they will become beneficiaries of the new covenant.\r\nb. To Refine and Purify the Sons of Levi\r\nChrist will come also to refine and purify the sons of Levi, mainly the priests, like a refiner's fire and like fuller's soap that they may offer to God the proper sacrifice (Mal. 3:2-4). In the millennium the repentant Jews who are regenerated through the new covenant will be the priests to take care of all the nations. For this they will need much refining and purifying. Therefore, in His second coming Christ will renew, sanctify, and transform Israel to be His refined and purified priests.\r\n\r\nThe book of Malachi is on Christ directly. In this message I have the burden to give a further word on the revelation of Christ in Malachi.\r\nCHRIST COMING AS THE MESSENGER OF GOD\r\nThe book of Malachi reveals Christ in His first coming and in His second coming. In His first coming He is the Messenger of God. As the Messenger of God, Christ not only brings a word or a message from God to God's people; He Himself is the living message. This is fully proved by the four Gospels, which are a complete and perfect record of Christ as the living message sent by God to His chosen people. While the Lord Jesus was living on earth, as He traveled through the cities and as He spoke to the people, ministering Himself into the intrinsic part of their being, He Himself was the message.\r\nCHRIST COMING AS THE ANGEL OF THE COVENANT\r\nEnacting the New Covenant\r\nIn His second coming, Christ will be the Angel of the covenant, the Desire of nations (3:1), and the Sun of righteousness (4:2). Actually, Christ was the Angel of the covenant even in His first coming. As the Angel of the covenant, Christ enacted the new covenant. Before going to the cross, the last thing He did was to establish the new covenant at His table (Matt. 26:26-30).\r\n\r\n The Believers, as Sons of God,\r\nBeing One with God in His Life and Nature\r\nBased upon this new covenant (Heb. 8:10-12), we are forgiven by God, who even forgets our failures. God is then able to dispense Himself into our intrinsic being to be our life, to be the law of life, and to be everything to us as our inward content that we may live Him. This means that the new covenant is to make us absolutely one with God. He becomes us, and we, being constituted with Him, are one with Him in His life and nature. The New Testament reveals that He and we form a mutual abode (John 14:20, 23). What a miracle this is!\r\nWe need to have the proper understanding of what it means to say that God has been constituted into us to become us and that we have become one with God in His life and nature. The New Testament reveals that God is our Father and that we are His sons. We are not sons who have been adopted by God but sons who have been born of God. God is our Father because He has begotten us, and we are His sons because we have been born of Him. Just as a child shares the life and nature of his father but not the fatherhood, so we as sons born of God share God's life and nature but not His fatherhood nor His Godhead. We are the same as God our Father in life and nature, but we surely are not God in His Godhead or the Father in His fatherhood. This is the intrinsic revelation of the Bible, especially of the New Testament.\r\nIn our daily living, we need to remember our status as sons of God possessing the life and nature of God. For example, if a brother and his wife both realize this, knowing that they are not only human but also divine, they will respect each other to the uttermost. Instead of disputing, they will honor each other and be kind to each other. Also, this realization will keep them from losing their temper. When we are tempted to lose our temper, we need to remember that we are sons of God. Even in such a matter as shopping in a department store, we should not forget our status as sons of God.\r\nCHRIST COMING AS THE DESIRE OF THE NATIONS\r\nIn His second coming, Christ will also be the Desire of the nations (Mal. 3:1; Hag. 2:7). Christ is the One whom we desire. Day by day we desire Him to be our love, our humility, our meekness, and our joy. Nothing is better than joy. This joy becomes our strength, our healing, our feeding, and our nourishment. Real joy comes from Christ being our life, our virtues, and our everything. I can testify that I have been loving this One for over seventy years, and I love Him today much more than ever. Daily I desire Him, love Him, and consider Him. He surely is our Desire.\r\n\r\n CHRIST COMING AS THE SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS\r\nWITH HEALING IN HIS WINGS\r\nAs the Sun of righteousness, Christ will come with healing in His wings (Mal. 4:2). Today the Pentecostal people practice what is called divine healing. Actually, Christ Himself is our healing. He is the Sun that heals us as it shines upon us.\r\nIn His first coming, the earth rejected Christ; therefore, the earth lacks His healing. But because we have received Him in a secret, hidden way, we receive His healing every day. His healing causes us to have joy so that we forget our anger and anxiety. We are sick from sin, death, and many deficiencies and imperfections. Only this healing Christ can make us whole. To be healed is to be saved. To be healed, to be saved, is to be made whole. He will heal us, but we must give Him the freedom to use His wings to fly above us, around us, and within us.\r\nIn His first coming, Christ healed the degraded priesthood, but in His second coming, He will heal the remnant of the people of Israel. Then He will be everything to the earth and to us. This healing Christ will come suddenly. Thus, we need to be alert, ready to receive Him.\r\nTHE CENTER OF THE BOOK OF MALACHI\r\nThe center of the book of Malachi is the healing Christ. This healing Christ is the Messenger of God, the Angel of the covenant, and the Desire of the nations. Christ's being our healing is based upon His being the Sun of righteousness. The word \"Sun\" indicates life, and the word \"righteousness\" indicates justice. The whole earth is filled with death and injustice, but with the healing Christ we have life and justice. We are waiting for Him to come as the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings.\r\n\r\nIV. JEHOVAH'S DEALING\r\nWITH THE SONS OF JACOB\r\nA. Jehovah's Judgment by His Drawing Near\r\nMalachi 3:5 and 6 speak of Jehovah's judgment by His drawing near. In our experience, every time the Lord appears to us, He rebukes us. His rebuking is His judgment.\r\n1. On Those Who Do Not Fear Jehovah\r\nVerse 5 tells us that Jehovah would be a swift witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers, against those who swear falsely, against those who oppress the hired worker, the widow, and the orphan, against those who turn the stranger aside, and against those who do not fear Jehovah. Jehovah's concern for the stranger indicates that He is very human and that He is not happy when His people ill-treat a stranger instead of giving him hospitality.\r\n\r\n1. Instructing Them to Return to Him\r\nso That He Would Return to Them\r\nThat They Might Be Blessed by Him\r\n\"From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from My statutes and have not kept them. Return to Me, and I will return to you, says Jehovah of hosts\" (v. 7). Here Jehovah instructed the sons of Jacob to return to Him so that He would return to them that they might be blessed by Him (vv. 10, 12). To be blessed by God is to be healed (4:2), and to be healed is to be made whole.\r\na. Not Robbing God in Tithes and Offerings\r\nWhereas Haggai touches the laziness of God's people in their not working to build God's house, Malachi speaks concerning their robbing God in tithes and offerings. \"Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed Me. But you say, How have we robbed You? In tithes and offerings. With the curse you are cursed, yet you, even the whole nation, rob Me\" (3:8-9). Here we see that after advising the sons of Jacob to return to Him, Jehovah charged them not to rob God in tithes and offerings that the curse would not be brought in to them. To rob God is to not give Him what He is due. He established the principle that of all the produce from the land, one tenth should go to Him (Lev. 27:30). The top tenth must go to Him.\r\nb. Bringing the Whole Tithe to the Storehouse\r\nThat There May Be Food in God's House\r\n\"Bring the whole tithe to the storehouse that there may be food in My house; and prove Me, if you will, by this, says Jehovah of hosts, whether I will open to you the windows of heaven and pour out blessing for you until there is no room for it\" (Mal. 3:10). Here we are told that when the first tenth is brought to the storehouse, God opens the windows of heaven and pours out a blessing until there is no room for it.\r\nThis verse speaks of food in God's house. This food is not for us—it is for God. God is hungry and needs food. What is God's food? God's food, the divine food, is the offerings, especially the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering. The peace offering is enjoyed mutually by God and His people. We enjoy this offering before Him and with Him.\r\n\r\nb. A Book of Remembrance Being Written before Jehovah\r\nVerse 16b tells us that a book of remembrance was written before Jehovah of those who feared Him and considered His name. We today consider, love, regard, respect, and sanctify God's name, and He keeps a record of this. We may not remember our fellowship concerning Christ and the church, but God keeps a record of this fellowship in His book of remembrance.\r\n\r\n3. Charging the Sons of Jacob\r\nto Remember the Law of Moses,\r\nthe Statutes and the Judgments\r\nIn verse 4 the sons of Jacob were charged to remember the law of Moses, that is, the statutes and judgments. The law is the Ten Commandments; the statutes are detailed items of the law; and the judgments are ordinances. When a judgment is added to a statute, that statute becomes an ordinance. For example, the commandment to keep the Sabbath and not to profane it, lacking any mention of judgment, is simply a statute. But when a judgment is added, perhaps the sentence of death by stoning, the statute becomes an ordinance.\r\n4. Promising to Send Elijah the Prophet to Them\r\nbefore the Great and Terrible Day\r\nof Jehovah Comes\r\nFinally, in verses 5 and 6, God promised to send Elijah the prophet to them before the great and terrible day of Jehovah comes (Matt. 17:10-11; Rev. 11:3-4). Elijah will turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to the fathers, lest Jehovah comes and strikes the land with a curse. This is the closing word of Malachi and the last word of the Old Testament.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REVIVAL REVEALED IN THE MINOR PROPHETS\r\nScripture Reading: Hab. 3:2a; Hosea 6:2; Joel 2:28-29; Hag. 1:14; Mal. 3:1b; Hag. 2:7a; Heb. 7:22; Acts 26:18b; Col. 1:12; Mal. 4:2a; Rom. 8:20-22\r\nIn this message, I have the burden to speak a word concerning the revival revealed in the Minor Prophets. We may say that this matter of revival is the \"kernel\" within the \"shell\" of the books of the Minor Prophets.\r\nI. THE ASPIRATION OF GOD'S ELECT\r\nHabakkuk 3:2a speaks of revival: \"O Jehovah, revive Your work/In the midst of the years.\" Among God's elect there has always been an aspiration to be revived. As long as you are a saved one, every day, consciously or unconsciously, there is an aspiration with a spontaneous prayer within you: \"O Lord, revive us.\" Although we may not realize it, such an aspiration has been within us through all the years of our Christian life.\r\nWe may think that Habakkuk's prayer for revival was good for him but has nothing to do with us. However, regarding his prayer, we need to realize that with God there is no time element. In the eyes of God, one person among His elect represents the whole. God always considers His elect as a corporate Body. This means that Habakkuk and we are one in the unit of God's elect. Thus, when Habakkuk prayed for revival, we also prayed. We prayed for revival twenty-six hundred years ago. Such a prayer is an everlasting prayer.\r\nMany times in the last six years I charged the saints to put the God-ordained way into a living practice, but without a revival, how could we have anything living? If we endeavor to practice just the first step of the God-ordained way—to visit people for the gospel—without being revived, this will be a heavy burden that no one can bear. We all need to realize that we have been saved and kept on earth to do one thing—to go to disciple the nations, beginning from \"Jerusalem\" and spreading to \"Judea,\" to \"Samaria,\" and to the uttermost part of the earth (Acts 1:8). If we live for our education, a career, a good marriage, or a nice house, that is vanity of vanities. We are living here for the spreading of the Lord Jesus, not merely to our neighborhood but to the entire world. If we would do this, we need to be revived. This is why the Lord has led us to practice the morning revival.\r\nThis matter of morning revival is according to the natural law in God's creation. God created the universe so that there is a sunrising every twenty-four hours. We believers should follow the sunrising to be revived every morning. Every day we need a \"sunrising,\" and this sunrising is a revival. If we experience a daily revival, then we will be living and qualified to practice the God-ordained way and to help the church to take this way.\r\n\r\n II. THE DESOLATION OF THE \"TWO DAYS\"\r\nAND THE RESURRECTION ON THE \"THIRD DAY\"\r\nOn the one hand, Habakkuk prayed for revival; on the other hand, Hosea spoke of the desolation of the \"two days\" and the resurrection on the \"third day\": \"He will enliven us after two days;/On the third day He will raise us up\" (6:2). Since to God a thousand years are as one day (2 Pet. 3:8), these \"two days\" may refer to a period of two thousand years. For almost two thousand years, from the time Titus destroyed Jerusalem and the temple in A.D. 70, Israel, our representative, has been desolate. From that year Israel lost the priesthood, the sacrifices, the prophets, the king, and the temple. Eventually, there will be the \"third day\"—the thousand years of the millennial kingdom—when Israel will be raised up, that is, restored.\r\nThe principle is the same in our Christian life. At a certain time we became desolate. After the two days of desolation, there is the third day, which signifies the pneumatic Christ in resurrection. Today we may receive the pneumatic Christ in resurrection and thus enjoy the reality of His resurrection. If we have the resurrected Christ, we are in the morning, the sunrising, and this is a real revival to us.\r\nIn 1984 I realized that the recovery was in a dormant condition, like the desolation of the two days in Hosea 6:2. However, if we experience a real revival, we will be in the third day.\r\nIII. THE OUTPOURING OF THE SPIRIT\r\nJoel 2:28 and 29 speak of the outpouring of the Spirit. Every day we need the outpouring of the all-inclusive, consummated, compound, life-giving Spirit as the processed and consummated Triune God. This all-inclusive Spirit includes Christ's divinity and humanity, the effectiveness of His death, and the power of His resurrection. This Spirit is our portion, our inheritance.\r\n\r\n IV. THE RESPONSE OF GOD'S ELECT\r\n\"Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people\" (Hag. 1:14a). Here we see the response of God's elect, who were stirred up by the Lord in the order of God's authority. When they responded by being stirred up in their spirit by the Lord, we all were included.\r\nIn the Minor Prophets there are both the divine Spirit, the consummated Spirit of God, and the human spirit, the stirred-up spirit of God's elect. The divine Spirit has been poured out, and our human spirit (the key to experiencing and enjoying Christ) responds to such a Spirit by being stirred up.\r\nWe may feel that our spirit was stirred up early in our Christian life but that it is no longer stirred up. However, this is not true. Unconsciously, the spirit of every regenerated believer is stirred up. If we go to a place of worldly entertainment, our spirit will be stirred up to tell us to leave that place. Whenever we grieve the Spirit (Eph. 4:30), we have no peace. This is the stirring up of our spirit. When we read the Bible, we feel calm and peaceful. Even in this calmness, our spirit is under the stirring up by the Spirit. Every day we cannot avoid the stirring up of our spirit. The Bible reveals that once the consummated, compound, life-giving Spirit comes into us, He will never leave. As He dwells in us, He is often a \"troublemaker,\" stirring us up either negatively or positively. If we take care of this negative or positive stirring up, we will be revived, and we will be strengthened and encouraged to carry out the God-ordained way.\r\nV. THE ENJOYMENT OF GOD'S CHRIST\r\nThe Minor Prophets also reveal that God's Christ is our enjoyment. The enjoyment of God's Christ is actually the enjoyment of God Himself.\r\nA. As the Desire of God's Elect\r\nWe may enjoy Christ as the Desire of God's elect (Mal. 3:1b; cf. Hag. 2:7a). Whether we are hot or cold toward the Lord, we desire Christ. Can you say that you have no desire for Christ? Every day we desire Christ.\r\n\r\nThe Universal Aspiration for Revival\r\nThe revival revealed in the Minor Prophets can be applied to the family, to the church, to the nations, to the entire human race, and even to the whole universe. In principle, everything and everyone on earth are in the desolation of the two days spoken of in Hosea 6:2.\r\nSince the fall of man, there has been in all of creation an aspiration for revival. Concerning this, Romans 8:20-22 says, \"The creation was made subject to vanity, not of its own will, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will also be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groans together and travails in pain together until now.\" As a result of Adam's fall, corruption, slavery, and death have come into the whole creation. Today everything is decaying and is under the slavery of corruption. All the things that are under this slavery aspire to be revived.\r\nChrist—the Reality of the Third Day\r\nMan's fall brought in corruption, and with corruption there is slavery. Because of this corruption and slavery, there is the need everywhere for revival, for restoration. This need can be met only by Christ and in Christ. Christ was resurrected on the third day, and as the pneumatic Christ in resurrection, He is the reality of the third day. Christ, therefore, is the element of the revival for which all of creation aspires. The corruption and desolation can be swallowed up only by Christ's resurrection.\r\nUnbelievers as well as believers aspire to be revived, to have a new beginning. Everyone wants something new. Only Christ is the renewing factor. Only Christ, who rose up on the third day, is the renewing power. For the whole universe and for all of mankind, Christ is the reality of the third day.\r\nWhen we received Christ, we received Him as the One who is Himself the resurrection (John 11:25). Immediately after receiving Him, we had a new beginning in our human life. That new beginning was a revival. However, eventually we again entered into a state of desolation and thus needed another revival. This cycle of desolation and revival, revival and desolation, has been repeated again and again.\r\nThe way to have the revival we need is to contact Christ, repenting and confessing our sins, failures, and darkness. By doing this we are brought from the desolation of the two days to the resurrection of the third day. Whenever we are in desolation we need such a revival. We need to come to the third day, and the third day is nothing other than the person of the resurrected Christ with the reality of revival. In addition, we have the outpouring of the Triune God as the consummated, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, and our spirit responds by being stirred up.\r\n\r\n Enjoying Christ as the One Desired by Mankind\r\nWhen our spirit is stirred up in response to the outpouring of the Spirit, we enjoy Christ not only as the resurrected One but also as the One desired by all of mankind. He is mankind's unique need. Everyone, the believers and the unbelievers alike, desires Christ.\r\nThe Christ we desire has enacted the new covenant and He, as its surety, is now executing it. Through this covenant God has been allotted to us as our legal portion in Christ, who is the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings. Apart from Him, we have darkness and unrighteousness, but with Him everything is light and righteousness.\r\nThe Ultimate Restoration\r\nWhen we have such a Christ, we not only have revival—we have restoration. The millennial kingdom will be a time of restoration. This restoration will consummate in the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem as the center. That will be the ultimate, the consummate, restoration accomplished by the resurrected Christ.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
